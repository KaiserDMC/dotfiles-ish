# dotfiles-ish (Windows)

Setup files for various applications I used to use on Windows, hence the "-ish" in the title.

## Info

- Nilesoft config is compatible until v1.7
- Neovim setup is based on typecraft's "neovim for newbs" [tutorial](https://github.com/cpow/neovim-for-newbs) with some personal customizations.
